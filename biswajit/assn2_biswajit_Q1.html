	<h3>From the garage to the Googleplex</h3>
	<p>
		The Google story begins in 1995 at <strong><em>Stanford University</em></strong>.
		<br>
		<strong><em>Larry Page</em></strong> was considering Stanford for grad school and <strong><em>Sergey Brin<em></strong>, a student there, was assigned to show him around.
	</p>
	<p>
		By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
		year they struck a <mark>partnership</mark>.
		Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
		individual pages on the <strong style="color: blue;">World Wide Web</strong> .
	</p>
	<p>
		They called this search engine <mark style="background-color: lightblue">Backrub</mark>.
