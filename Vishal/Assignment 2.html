    <h2> From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
    <p> The Google story begins in 1995 at <em><b>Stanford University.
    Larry Page</b></em> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b>Sergey Brin,</b> a student
    there, was assigned to show him around.</p>
    <p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
        year they struck a  <h style="background-color: blue;"> partnership.</h></p>
    <p>Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
        individual pages on the <h style="color: aqua;">World Wide Web .</h></p> 
    <p>They called this search engine <em><h style="background-color: blue;"> Backrub.</h></em></p>
