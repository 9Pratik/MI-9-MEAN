    <p>Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order
        Lepidoptera, which also includes moths. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly
        coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large
        superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains at least one former group, the skippers
        (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea"), and the most recent analyses suggest it
        also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea").
        Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago.<br>
        Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which
        their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully
        developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs
        out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics,
        have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take
        several years to pass through their entire life cycle.<br> Adult butterflies have large, often brightly
