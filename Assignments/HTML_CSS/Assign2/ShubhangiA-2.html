    <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
    <p style=font-size:120%>The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University.</b>
        <br>
        <b><em>Larry Page</em></b> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b><em>Sergey Brin,</em></b> a student
        there, was assigned to show him around.</p>
    <br>
    By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
    year they struck a <span style=background-color:purple>partnership.</span>
    <br>
    Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
    individual pages on the <span style="color:blue">world Wide Web </span>.
    <br>
    They called this search engine <i style=background-color:yellow>Backrub.</i>
