            <p>Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order
                Lepidoptera, which also includes moths. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly
                coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large
                superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains at least one former group, the skippers
                (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea"), and the most recent analyses suggest it
                also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea").
                Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago.
                Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on
                which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and
                when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the
                adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies,
                especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation,
                and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.
                Butterflies are distributed worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species.[18] Of these, 775 are
                Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 are distributed across the combined
                Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions.[18] The monarch butterfly is native to the Americas, but in the
                nineteenth century or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts
                of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by the wind
                or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants in
                their new environment was a necessity for their successful establishment.[19] Some butterflies,
