<h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>

<p>The Google story begins in 1995 at <B>Stanford University.</B>
<br>
<b><I>Larry Page</I></b>
was considering Stanford for grad school and 
<b><I>Sergey Brin</I> </b>
,a student there, was assigned to show him around.
<br>

<p> By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting,but by the following year they struck a <mark> partnership </mark>.<br>Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of individual pages on the <b><span style="color:purple;">World Wide Web.</b></span> </p>
<br>
They called this search engine <span style="background-color: cyan;">Backrub</span>.
